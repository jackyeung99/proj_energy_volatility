Main Idea/ Hypothesis 
Does anomolies in weather help explain volatility of energy companies 



To Do
1. Connect with trading account
2. get access to tech stocks, specifically information on Fama five factor features 
3. research locations of energy sources in U.S (eGRID)
4. gather historical weather data for those locations 
5. Fit model time series model to this location (spectral)
6. Quantify what a weather anomoly is (temperature, rain, snow, etc. )
    Challenge: Different energy sources are affected by different weather patterns
7. Connect weather anomolies with volatility (what resource is most affected by weather)
8. use information on volatilty to trade
